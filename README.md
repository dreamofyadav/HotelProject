Rentify – Full-Stack Property Rental Web App

Rentify is a full-stack web application that enables users to list, discover, and book rental properties — a modern platform for hosting and finding stays, built with performance and scalability in mind.

🔥 This project was built to replicate the core functionalities of a vacation rental platform like Airbnb, while enhancing my skills in full-stack development, RESTful APIs, and responsive design.
